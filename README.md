# COP2000 - Introduction to Programming

## Description
This course is intended to introduce students to the concepts of computer logic and programming with, at present, the Python language. Problem solving skills using logical thinking are emphasized. Topics include but are not limited to: a brief history of computers and programming languages, how to develop a program, the three basic programming control structures (sequence, selection, and repetition), lists and tuples, I/O using text, binary, and csv data files, program modules and functions, debugging, exception handling, and using built-in modules. There will be, if time permits, an introduction to object-oriented programming. The student is expected to use some math skills at the Intermediate Algebra level.[^1]

## Projects
- [Project 1](https://github.com/nasumilu-owner/cop2002/tree/main/Project%201) a very simple program that obtains input from the user to calculate the area and perimeter of a parallelogram.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/nasumilu-owner/cop2002/tree/main/Project%202) a very simple program that obtains a whole number input from the user. After determining whether the number is even or odd it calculates the sum of even or odd numbers within the range, inclusively.
- [Project 3](https://github.com/nasumilu-owner/cop2002/tree/main/Project%203) a very simple program that obtains home value input and calculates the minimum, maximum, average and mean home value.
- Project 4 (not provdied) was a debug exercise for existing code with had both compile and logic errors.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/nasumilu-owner/cop2002/tree/main/Project%205) a program calculates the amount of time and fuel a Cessna 172N takes to fly a specific distance.
- [Project 6](https://github.com/nasumilu-owner/cop2002/tree/main/Project%206) a simple program that calculates the interest on a loan.
