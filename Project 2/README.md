# COP2002 - Project 2

## Description
A very simple program that obtains a whole number input
from the user. After determining whether the number is even or 
odd it calculates the sum of even or odd numbers within 
the range, inclusively. 

## Usage

```bash
$ ./ml-sums.py
```
Expected output
```bash
Sum of odd and even numbers
========================================
Enter a whole number between 1 and 50: 10

Your number is an even number.
The sum of the even numbers from 2 to 10 is: 30


Try again? (y/n)y   
Enter a whole number between 1 and 50: 9

Your number is an odd number.
The sum of the odd numbers from 1 to 9 is: 25


Try again? (y/n)n
