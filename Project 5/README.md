## Description
This program calculates the amount of time and fuel a Cessna 172N 
takes to fly a specific distance. The program uses following assumptions:

- Assume 120 nautical miles (knots) per hour
- Assume 8.4 gallons of fuel per hour
- Add 0.5 hour to flight time when calculation the amount of fuel 
- Round the fuel amount to the 1/10th place, alway rounding up

## Usage
Running
```bash
$ ./ml-flights.py
```
